# Shortest Path Finder

This project is a GUI-based application to find the shortest path between two nodes on a map using the A* algorithm. The application uses the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for the map and NetworkX for graph processing. The GUI is built with Tkinter.

## Features

- Load a map from an OSM file and convert it to a graph.
- Use the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two selected nodes.
- Visualize the shortest path on the map.
